Hi! I am a research assistant in Shanghai Qizhi Institute, working with Prof. Tao Du. Currently my research interest lies in computer graphics, especially in the topic of physically-based simulation. I am curious about the relationship of simulation and geometry representation.

Before that, I received my M.E. in computer science from Nankai University, advised by Pro. Bo Ren. I received my B.E. in Process equipment and control engineering from South China University of Technology.
